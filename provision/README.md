For a new machine, scripts that install the necessary packages and other server
things go here.  The working directory is always this directory.


If using on a new machine without dotfiles yet, do something like

    curl https://github.com/naggie/dotfiles/raw/master/provision/ubuntu-12.04-server | bash
